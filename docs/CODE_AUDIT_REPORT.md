## 9. Conclusion

The Flutter codebase has a solid foundation with proper architecture, theme system, and basic components. However, significant gaps exist between the implemented code and the comprehensive PRD specifications. The codebase currently implements approximately 45% of the PRD requirements.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Major screen gaps** - 20 out of 31 screens missing
2. **Incomplete component library** - 40+ out of 50+ components missing
3. **Partial design token system** - Advanced tokens missing
4. **Incomplete user flows** - Send flow only 4 steps instead of 6+
5. **Limited animation system** - Only basic press feedback implemented

**Recommendation:** Focus on High Priority fixes first to achieve MVP functionality, then proceed with Medium and Low Priority improvements to reach 95%+ alignment with the PRD.

The codebase is well-structured and ready for rapid development to close these gaps and achieve full PRD compliance.
