## 4. Implementation Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**
1. Update PRD with missing screens (Welcome, System States Demo)
2. Document comprehensive Send Money Flow
3. Add missing design tokens (chart colors, sidebar colors)

### **Short Term (Week 2-3)**
1. Document all UI components in design system
2. Add multi-currency support documentation
3. Document animation and interaction specifications

### **Medium Term (Month 1)**
1. Implement missing M-Pesa limit screens in design
2. Add comprehensive notification system to design
3. Align business logic documentation with design capabilities

### **Long Term (Month 2+)**
1. Create comprehensive component documentation
2. Add accessibility and responsive design specifications
3. Implement advanced error handling flows

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

### **High Risk**
- **User Flow Gaps:** Missing comprehensive Send Money Flow could lead to implementation confusion
- **Component Gaps:** 25+ undocumented components could lead to inconsistent implementation
- **Token Gaps:** Missing design tokens could lead to hardcoded values

### **Medium Risk**
- **Animation Gaps:** Missing animation specifications could lead to inconsistent user experience
- **Error Handling Gaps:** Missing error state documentation could lead to poor error handling

### **Low Risk**
- **Feature Gaps:** Missing advanced features are nice-to-have but not critical for MVP

## 6. Conclusion

The PRD and Figma design show strong alignment in core functionality (78% overall), but significant gaps exist in screen coverage, component documentation, and user flow completeness. The design system is more comprehensive than documented, suggesting the PRD needs substantial updates to capture the full scope of the designed experience.

**Priority Focus:** Update PRD to document the comprehensive Send Money Flow, add missing screens, and document the full component library to achieve 90%+ alignment.
