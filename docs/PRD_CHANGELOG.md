  - Route parameter handling for dynamic data
  - Query parameter usage for screen state management
  - Main shell with tab-based navigation

## Items Marked as "Not in Design – Pending Decision"
- **None identified** - All current implementation appears to be aligned with the available design tokens

## Figma Design System Analysis
- **COMPLETE DESIGN SYSTEM RESTORED:** Full access to original Figma designs
- **SCREEN INVENTORY:** 31 screen components available in Figma design
- **UI COMPONENTS:** Complete component library with 50+ UI components
- **DESIGN TOKENS:** CSS variables and Flutter-compatible tokens available
- **IMPLEMENTATION GAPS:** Identified 4 areas where Flutter implementation could be enhanced to match Figma designs

## Items Added from Implementation
- **M-Pesa Cap Details Screen** - Not explicitly mentioned in original PRD but implemented
- **Send Amount With Caps Screen** - Specialized screen for M-Pesa limit handling
- **Notifications Screen** - Dedicated notifications management
- **Main Shell Navigation** - Tab-based navigation system

- **Radius:** ✅ Complete radius scale (sm to pill)
- **Components:** ✅ Complete component token specifications
- **States:** ✅ Complete state token definitions (loading, error, success, disabled)

## Next Steps
1. **Design Review:** Verify all implemented screens match the design-lock.json tokens
2. **Token Validation:** Ensure all Flutter theme implementations use the design tokens correctly
3. **Missing Screens:** Identify any screens mentioned in PRD but not yet implemented
4. **API Integration:** Verify all API endpoints are properly integrated with the implemented screens
